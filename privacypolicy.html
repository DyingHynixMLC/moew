    <h1>moew Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
    This Privacy Policy describes how your data is collected, used, and protected when using the Bot.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Data Collected</strong><br>
    The Bot does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or store any user data related to your interactions. The Bot only processes the commands you send to fetch random pictures of cats and foxes from external APIs.</p>

    <p>The API calls made to The Cat API and RandomFox API may log basic usage data, such as IP addresses or user-agent information, but this data is outside the control of the Bot developer.</p>

    <p><strong>3. How We Use Data</strong><br>
    - The Bot processes user commands to retrieve cat and fox images. No additional user data is stored or used for purposes other than responding to the user's request.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Data Sharing</strong><br>
    - The Bot does not share or sell any personal data.<br>
    - The external APIs (The Cat API and RandomFox API) may collect and use data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Data Security</strong><br>
    While we take precautions to ensure the security of user data, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Third-Party Services</strong><br>
    The Bot uses third-party services to fetch random cat and fox images. The use of these APIs is governed by their respective privacy policies:<br>
    - <a href="https://thecatapi.com/privacy" target="_blank">The Cat API Privacy Policy</a><br>
    - <a href="https://randomfox.ca/privacy" target="_blank">RandomFox API Privacy Policy</a></p>

    <p><strong>7. User Rights</strong><br>
    Since the Bot does not collect personal information, there is no personal data stored or shared by the Bot. However, if you have concerns about data collected by the external APIs, please refer to their privacy policies.</p>

    <p><strong>8. Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong><br>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated date.</p>

    <p><strong>9. Contact Information</strong><br>
    For any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please <a href="https://github.com/DyingHynixMLC" target="_blank">contact the bot developer on GitHub</a>.</p>
